### Intuition

As naturally as you use a branch on the tree as a hoe, you should also be able to use the bar stool **yno**.
This intuition is reflected in a childlike-naive, partly playful design. Thus, each function is clearly assigned to a component.

The different surfaces of the foot and the upper part enhance the recognizability of the rotating function of the seat.
