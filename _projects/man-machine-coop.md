Based on philosophical research on what makes people so special and where the differences to machines are, the thesis was put forward that cooperative collaboration at eye level between man and machine can have a positive impact on the working area of design.

To examine this thesis, an interactive machine was build and programmed with *vvvv*.

This machine actively responds to people and their ideas, but also contributes  its own suggestions. 

<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">

</div>

The jointly created object is thus influenced by the interplay of human and machine abilities and is not limited by manâ€™s imagination.

The results of this experiment were compiled in a [scientific paper](https://www.academia.edu/33594517/Mensch-Maschinen_Kooperation) and submitted for participation to the bf-prize 2016.
