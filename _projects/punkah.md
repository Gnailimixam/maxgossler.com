The punkah is a ceiling fan that was swung by a servant manually. This principle has been applied during the colonial era in India and with the help of electricity it was used for ventilation all around the world at the end of the 19th century. The gentle movement fascinated me so much that I wanted to bring the punkah back to life. 

The model for the gentle movement and the efficient aerodynamics was the bird wing.  The special design with the motor sitting inside the wing allows several arrangements, such as a double-wing or a mounting directly to the wall.

A possible scenario for the use of the punkah, could be an individual ventilation at the workplace.
